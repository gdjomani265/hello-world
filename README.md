# hello-world

Hello,

My name is Gilles. I have determined myself to become an expert programmer, developer, and product manager. I have previously programmed using C++, Python, and HTML5. However, because of the lack of motivation I failed to fully build these programming skills. I would like to change that and encode a brighter future for myself!
